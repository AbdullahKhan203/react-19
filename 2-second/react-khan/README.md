<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->



<!-- start project command:- npm run dev -->


<!--  why my bun project have two files app.css and index.css ? -->


<!-- In a typical React project, having both app.css and index.css files is common for organizing styles. Here's why you might have both:

index.css: This file usually contains global styles that apply to the entire application. It is often imported in the index.js or index.jsx file, which is the entry point of the React application. These styles might include resets, typography, and other global settings.

app.css: This file typically contains styles specific to the App component. It is imported in the App.jsx or App.js file. These styles are scoped to the App component and its children, helping to keep styles modular and easier to manage. -->
